# Simple implementation of Equivariant GNN

- A short (50 lines of code) and easy implementation of [E(n) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09844.pdf).
- The implementation is Pure PyTorch, it has no external packages like PyTorch-geometric.
- Closely match Mean Absolute Error reported in the paper.
